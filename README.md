# What is it?
This is a simple website that contains a welcome page, sign up page, and a thank you page. On the welcome page there is a href link that lets the user click onto the sign up page. Once at the sign up page the user can enter their username and password (these credentials are not hashed and should not be anything real as they are just stored in a txt file). After the information is entered the user can press sign up and are then taken to the thank you page. On the thank you page the user may return to the welcome page or shut down the website.

# Why did I make it?
I made this project for the purpose of experimenting further with HTMl as it is a language I have not exposed myself to much but also extending my knowledge of python into flask which is a web framework

# What do I want to add?
In the next versions I want to add some key features for the frontend and backend. On the front end I want to add CSS to make the websites pages look more appealing. On the backend I would like to experiment with hashing passwords and databases such as sql.
